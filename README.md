	I've used Pycharm IDE, Django framework, MySQL and Rest API to create this project. 

	I created Log In page with Django User authentications and also for register page. The data is saving at the backend at the backend with all the fields. The unique field is email as well as username too since I used user authentication.

	I tried my best to make crud operations from HTML template only but I wasn't able to do that. So we have to go to the REST API page with url '/details' to perform CRUD operations.

	In REST API, I've used Mixin for performing CRUD operations and used AJAX JQUERY for connecting web pages and showing the data.
